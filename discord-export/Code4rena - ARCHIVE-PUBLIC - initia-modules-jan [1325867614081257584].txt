👋 Hello and welcome to the** $60,000 in USDC Initia Rollup Modules** audit channel!

📆 Audit opens Tuesday, 07 January 2025 20:00 (20:00 UTC) and runs through Tuesday, 21 January 2025 20:00 (20:00 UTC) (14 days).

Please give a warm welcome to the Initia team, particularly @beer-1, @Leo.init, @ALPAC4, @Sawit, @hoon, and @Harvey who will be available for questions either here in the channel or via a PRIVATE thread. You can expect them to be available in GMT+7 and GMT+9 timezones.

🤖 **Documentation bot assistance:** For general questions about the codebase, give our documentation bot a try, by tagging `@Docs Wolf` in any thread (private or public) and asking your question. The bot will make its best attempt to answer based on the codebase and documentation, and link you to relevant resources.  *Docs Wolf will be available when the audit is live.*

We'll be posting relevant links, documentation, etc. here, so if you intend to participate in this audit, consider enabling notifications for this channel. 🐺 ⏰

Welcome @beer-1 , @Leo.init , @ALPAC4 , @Sawit , and @hoon
Would you recommend starting to review the modules over the bots?


[01/08/2025 15:12] tansawit
Yes personally would review the module first at least briefly to get an idea of what the (the majority of) bots are meant to function with

ℹ️ Wardens, FYI we've added @Harvey to the list of sponsor team members to tag in private threads if you have questions about the codebase.

What does `the sequence number of l1 bridge` mean for sequence parameter in MsgFinalizeTokenDeposit?


[01/13/2025 12:17] sh_cha
You can use it by referring to the two readmes below. https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots/blob/v0.1.12/README.md, https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots/blob/v0.1.12/executor/README.md. For docker, please refer to https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots/blob/v0.1.12/Dockerfile and let me know if you have any difficulties.
There is also an e2e test using interchaintest. https://github.com/initia-labs/opinit-bots/tree/v0.1.12/e2e

This refers to the sequence number in the l1 chain. It increases by one when MsgInitiateTokenDeposit is executed in the OPHost module. https://github.com/initia-labs/OPinit/blob/v0.6.2/x/ophost/keeper/msg_server.go#L234

Could you please re-confirm with @bytes032? C4 team says test files aren't in scope but sponsor says it is.

Hey @Jay | C4 can the readMe for the contest be updated with the type of ERC20 tokens the protocol integrates with?


[01/14/2025 21:53] itsmetechjay
@bytes032 for visibility


[01/15/2025 04:41] bytes032
There are no ERC20 tokens in Move.

Is the L2 ChainID `initia-1` correct? If so, check if the keyname set for `bridge_executor` in config.json matches  `bridge_executor` you registered.


[01/16/2025 03:23] sh_cha
The `output_proposer` or `output_submitter` must hold funds to send output proposal txs.

[01/16/2025 07:39] sh_cha
The output submitter is the account that sends the output proposal on `L1`. Therefore, it should be added to `initia-1`. Similarly, the bridge_executor exists on `L2`, so it is part of `minitia-1`.


[01/16/2025 09:28] lon9j1ng
ok ill try it.


[01/18/2025 03:30] uint256vieet
@Lon9J1ng @hoon  can you tell me how you set up the L1 and rollup node locally? I'm still stuck with it before running the bot. Is the L1 binary built from repo  initia and is the L2 binary built from minimove.

We have some staff outages that has caused a delay in awards. The first batch should be sent out soon! 

However, C4 staff have already started drafting the report for Initia Modules, which explains the status change that you're seeing in-app.
